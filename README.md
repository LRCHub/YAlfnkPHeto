```lrc
[00:18.67] Dear machine, I am haunted
[00:21.53] By a world that swallows me
[00:24.33] The ice beneath me, frozen memories
[00:27.94] Slowly breaking as I reach
[00:30.59] So can I climb through snow and ice
[00:34.26] Taking strides through this new life
[00:37.09] Or drift astray, as I decay
[00:40.15] The mountain claims me as its own
[00:56.65] 
[00:44.69] I just wanna crumble to the ground (please tell me how)
[00:50.97] All alone, can someone hold me now? (If I knew now)
[00:56.89] The winds, they're calling out to me
[01:01.98] And I can barely breathe
[01:04.31] Dear machine, can I break free
[01:07.94] From these thoughts that beckon me?
[01:25.44] 
[02:15.27] Fear has fallen down on me
[02:18.77] I'm buried in too deep
[02:21.87] I stumble to my feet
[02:24.42] Tears frozen to my cheek
[02:28.15] Dreams that bring me light
[02:30.82] They tell me to survive
[02:34.47] I'm reaching a life beyond the
[02:49.47] 
[02:39.81] Fear can take its toll on me
[02:44.05] If fear is all I see
[02:46.38] Come chase me as I seek
[02:50.54] A new reality
[02:52.79] I watch the northern lights
[02:56.35] They gleam against the night
[02:59.07] I choose to stay alive
[03:03.22] I'm reaching for
[03:11.22] 
[03:14.78] I'm reaching for a life beyond the peak
